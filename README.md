What is Scratch

Scratch is a free object-oriented software development kit (SDK) that allows children age 8-16 to create animations, interactive stories, games and music without needing to know a specific programming language. Scratch, which consists of a script, paint and sound editor, is maintained by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab and features an online community to encourage collaboration among young programmers.

With animation effects of Scratch, you can make your name come to life. It will be more fun when we add music to your name. This project here About animating each letter of the word “WELCOME TO KIDSTECH EXHIBITION” with Sound.
